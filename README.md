# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict employee salaries based on various features like job title, industry, education level, years of experience, location, and more. The model has been deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 📌 Project Overview
### 🔹 Objective:
To develop a predictive model that estimates salaries using historical employee data and helps HR professionals make data-driven compensation decisions.

### 🔹 Tech Stack Used:

1) Data Generation: Quadratic AI
2) Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas
3) Modeling: scikit-learn
4) Model Saving: Joblib
5) Deployment: Streamlit Cloud

## 🚀 Features
- Predict salary based on multiple inputs

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit

- Trained and evaluated multiple ML algorithms:
KNN Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
